Title: Ungulate Parturition Modeling and Predicting
Version: 0.3.1
Author: Matthew M. Hayes
Maintainer: Matthew M. Hayes <mhayes1@uwyo.edu>
Description: This package leverages ungulate movement data to model and predict 
    time and day of parturition. This is done using machine learning algorithms
    and simple movement statistics. These methods have been tested and verified
    only on ungulate (mule deer, elk and moose). As a courtesy, several functions
    that automate downloading data from common ungulate collar company websites
    are also included.
